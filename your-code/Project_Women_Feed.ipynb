Now, after a successful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cravings-Recipes-All-Food-Want/dp/1101903910?tag=mashable-editpost-20\" class=\"product-url\" rel=\"noskim\">cookbook</a> and line of <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/cravings-by-chrissy-teigen-12pc-aluminum-cookware-set/-/A-53780031\">cookware</a>, Teigen is returning to the kitchen and starting her own <a href=\"https://cravingsbychrissyteigen.com\">website</a> and YouTube cooking channel, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcjPceVu9a-5Qm8DsefUE4Q\"><em>Cravings</em></a>.</p>\\n<p>On the channel you can watch clips of her family life, her favorite dishes, and flip through cookbooks with her. You can also see Teigen and husband John Legend romp around Italy digging up truffles and exploring one of their favorite cities, Florence. As a whole, the channel feels more Food Network meets HGTV than a YouTube show &#8212; but that\\'s not a bad thing. <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/chrissy-teigen-launches-youtube-website-cravings-food/\">Read more...</a></p>More about <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/food/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Food</a>, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/cooking/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Cooking</a>, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/chrissy-teigen/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Chrissy Teigen</a>, <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/john-legend/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">John Legend</a>, and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/category/gourmet/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial\">Gourmet</a>',\n",

But pets are also <em>messy</em> &#8212;&#160;and unlike in a passive-aggressive roommate group chat, you can\\'t tell a pet to clean up after itself.&#160;</p>\\n<p>They pay no mind as to where they shed or track dirt. You&#8217;re forced to constantly clean up after them which, frankly, we find pretty rude. Fortunately, robot vacuums are here to save the day. Or, at the very least, help cut down on your housework.

But pets are also <em>messy</em> &#8212;&#160;and unlike in a passive-aggressive roommate group chat, you can\\'t tell a pet to clean up after itself.&#160;</p>\\n<p>They pay no mind as to where they shed or track dirt. You&#8217;re forced to constantly clean up after them which, frankly, we find pretty rude. Fortunately, robot vacuums are here to save the day. Or, at the very least, help cut down on your housework. These devices live for picking up stray bits of food, litter and hair, ensuring your home doesn&#8217;t turn into a den of debris. Of course, before you rush over to Amazon or (gasp!) an actual store, you&#8217;ll want find out which vacuum might be best for you. &#160; <a

Unfortunately, that\\'s far from accurate these days.&#160;</p>\\n<p>Macs are generally more secure than PCs, thanks to a more secure operating system where certain aspects of its software are more locked down and harder to infiltrate by rogue software. Also, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15176766/apple-microsoft-windows-10-vs-mac-users-figures-stats\">fewer people own Macs</a> meaning fewer targets for criminals.

While Android&#8217;s customization is great, the fact that they have an open platform makes them easier to hack and attack. And this can result in anything from lost photos and contacts to stolen credit card numbers and malware that bricks your phone, rendering it unusable and unrepairable. Fortunately, you can protect your Android by downloading an antivirus app. (Exhale deep sigh of relief now.) <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-antivirus-for-android/\">Read

Photograph: Jim Urquhart/ReutersThe engines, big and small, came from all over the country to fight the Kincade fire in the Sonoma county wine region of California. There were trucks from Nevada, South Dakota, Colorado – and from the wildfire protection unit of home insurer AIG.As fires have increasingly encroached on development in California’s wildlands in recent years, communities are grappling with a new paradigm of risk. If the fire creates an existential crisis for people living in high-risk areas, it also creates one for the companies that insure their homes.Insurers of houses, timber and agriculture have contracted with private firefighting agencies for decades. But now, thanks to longer, more devastating fire seasons, the business is booming.While some wealthy communities and individuals have contracted their own private firefighting services to defend mansions on hilltops from flying embers, the majority of these agencies work on behalf of insurance companies. And as fire risk extends to more homes in California’s flammable brushland and forest, these crews are becoming a fixture in middle class neighborhoods. It is something of a return to a pre-American civil war model of pay-for-play firefighting, before the government employed first responders.Firefighters protect a Pacific Palisades area home in Los Angeles from the flames of a wildfire. Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/Associated Press“Any policyholder that would like to have wildfire services, all they need to do is shop from more than a dozen insurers out there that have these services,” said David Torgerson, president of Wildfire Defense Systems, a private firefighting firm. “It’s not a special policy. It’s not something that’s exclusive. It’s something that the insurance industry has found brings value.”Insured losses for the 2018 California wildfire season topped $12bn. Insurance companies are looking for any way to reduce payouts in the future, whether by raising rates, dropping coverage, or putting new risk mitigation measures into place – including, in some cases, these kinds of private fire crews.The services they provide focus primarily on fire prevention mitigation – cutting back vegetation, creating clear defensible space around structures and providing consultations on other home hardening work. As in the Kincade fire, private crews also sometimes access mandatory evacuation zones during active wildfires to protect valuable assets while the embers are flying – a move that makes some government firefighters and local authorities uneasy.“Generally speaking, from our perspective, we have found that private fire crews are not first responders,” said Carroll Wills, communications director for California Professional Firefighters.Firefighters watch from a home in the Pacific Palisades area as a helicopter drops water on a wildfire. Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/Associated PressPrivate fire crews travel into evacuation zones in trucks equipped with water tanks and hoses and retardant, looking nearly identical to their government counterparts – though their sole task is to protect specific insured homes.Torgerson, president of Wildfire Defense Systems, noted that while his teams are capable of fighting fires, “that’s not our mission in this case”.“Our task with the insurance industry is more so to prepare the homes and secure them, prior to and after the fire, and contribute to the survivability,” he said.“Our [wildfire protection unit] teams are not private firefighters,” said Matt Gallagher, a spokesman for AIG – yet they station engines with full tanks in evacuation zones during wildfires that can turn dangerous within seconds.Lawmakers grew concerned that civilians would see these private engines and get a false sense of security about remaining in evacuation zones. Government firefighters voiced complaints about rolling onto a scene, believing the area to be fully evacuated, only to find private fire crews who had not alerted incident command.In the 2018 Woolsey fire, Kim Kardashian famously hired private firefighters to save her $50m Calabasas mansion – a crew that, said Wills, never told anyone of their plans. “That’s just incredibly dangerous,” Wills said. A helicopter drops water on a brush fire during the Woolsey Fire in Malibu, California. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/Associated PressPrior to the 2018 fire season, California lawmakers passed a bill requiring private crews to alert public incident command and obtain permission before entering an evacuation zone. The law codified a best-practice guideline put in place in 2008. Torgerson, who founded his company that same year, said his company has always followed these directives, and will continue to do so now that the law is in effect.“We’ve responded to more than 650 wildfires since 2008, and more than 97% of the time, we’ve been granted access to the evacuation zones to conduct these insurance missions,” he said. “We’ve coordinated with hundreds of incident command teams.”Torgerson said he does not know why his crews were not permitted 3% of the time.“We’re fully qualified under state and federal certification and training processes,” he said. “We are the same resources that the federal government hires.”But their mission is fundamentally different. Government firefighters are tasked with saving life, first and foremost, so if the fires turn and the private crews require rescue, “they are a liability”, Wills said.“We understand that when people see these massive fires, there’s a tendency to say, ‘Well, more is better’,” Wills said. “From our perspective, more really isn’t better. The more that we need is more fully trained and battle-tested, front-line firefighters and emergency responders.”<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

It is something of a return to a pre-American civil war model of pay-for-play firefighting, before the government employed first responders.Firefighters protect a Pacific Palisades area home in Los Angeles from the flames of a wildfire. Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/Associated Press“Any policyholder that would like to have wildfire services, all they need to do is shop from more than a dozen insurers out there that have these services,” said David Torgerson, president of Wildfire Defense Systems, a private firefighting firm. “It’s not a special policy. It’s not something that’s exclusive. It’s something that the insurance industry has found brings value.”Insured losses for the 2018 California wildfire season topped $12bn. Insurance companies are looking for any way to reduce payouts in the future, whether by raising rates, dropping coverage, or putting new risk mitigation measures into place – including, in some cases, these kinds of private fire crews.The services they provide focus primarily on fire prevention mitigation – cutting back vegetation, creating clear defensible space around structures and providing consultations on other home hardening work. As in the Kincade fire, private crews also sometimes access mandatory evacuation zones during active wildfires to protect valuable assets while the embers are flying – a move that makes some government firefighters and local authorities uneasy.“Generally speaking, from our perspective, we have found that private fire crews are not first responders,” said Carroll Wills, communications director for California Professional Firefighters.Firefighters watch from a home in the Pacific Palisades area as a helicopter drops water on a wildfire. Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/Associated PressPrivate fire crews travel into evacuation zones in trucks equipped with water tanks and hoses and retardant, looking nearly identical to their government counterparts – though their sole task is to protect specific insured homes.Torgerson, president of Wildfire Defense Systems, noted that while his teams are capable of fighting fires, “that’s not our mission in this case”.“Our task with the insurance industry is more so to prepare the homes and secure them, prior to and after the fire, and contribute to the survivability,” he said.“Our [wildfire protection unit] teams are not private firefighters,” said Matt Gallagher, a spokesman for AIG – yet they station engines with full tanks in evacuation zones during wildfires that can turn dangerous within seconds.Lawmakers grew concerned that civilians would see these private engines and get a false sense of security about remaining in evacuation zones. Government firefighters voiced complaints about rolling onto a scene, believing the area to be fully evacuated, only to find private fire crews who had not alerted incident command.In the 2018 Woolsey fire, Kim Kardashian famously hired private firefighters to save her $50m Calabasas mansion – a crew that, said Wills, never told anyone of their plans. “That’s just incredibly dangerous,” Wills said. A helicopter drops water on a brush fire during the Woolsey Fire in Malibu, California. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/Associated PressPrior to the 2018 fire season, California lawmakers passed a bill requiring private crews to alert public incident command and obtain permission before entering an evacuation zone. The law codified a best-practice guideline put in place in 2008. Torgerson, who founded his company that same year, said his company has always followed these directives, and will continue to do so now that the law is in effect.“We’ve responded to more than 650 wildfires since 2008, and more than 97% of the time, we’ve been granted access to the evacuation zones to conduct these insurance missions,” he said. “We’ve coordinated with hundreds of incident command teams.”Torgerson said he does not know why his crews were not permitted 3% of the time.“We’re fully qualified under state and federal certification and training processes,” he said. “We are the same resources that the federal government hires.”But their mission is fundamentally different. Government firefighters are tasked with saving life, first and foremost, so if the fires turn and the private crews require rescue, “they are a liability”, Wills said.“We understand that when people see these massive fires, there’s a tendency to say, ‘Well, more is better’,” Wills said. “From our perspective, more really isn’t better. The more that we need is more fully trained and battle-tested, front-line firefighters and emergency responders.”<p><br clear=\"all\">'},\n",

Tom Cole (R-OK) said on Sunday morning that while he believes the process has been “unfair” he hasn’t “closed the door completely” on approving articles of impeachment.During an appearance on NBC News’ Meet the Press, Cole took the position nearly all Republicans on Capitol Hill have embraced, claiming that the president pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals does not rise to the level of impeachment.\\xa0Meet the Press host Chuck Todd went on to ask Cole if there was a possible “middle ground” that Democrats could have pursued in terms of condemning the Ukraine scandal, wondering aloud if perhaps censuring Trump “would be a more appropriate way to go.”“Look, if I were the Democrats, I would&#39;ve chosen that,” the Oklahoma Republican replied. “But again, that’s up to them as to how they want to proceed. Personally, you know, I don&#39;t see anything here that I&#39;m likely to have censured the president for. So again, fair enough. I think, I think they&#39;ve made the decision they want to go for the whole ball of wax and it&#39;s not going to work.”Asked about Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI), a congressman who left the Republican Party after he voiced his support for impeachment, Cole went on to say that while he regards Amash as a friend he just “profoundly disagrees with him on this issue.”“I think he’s wrong,” he added. “Look, if I believed everything the Democrats are saying, I would still say this isn&#39;t an impeachable offense.”The NBC News anchor concluded the interview by asking Cole if after he’s had a chance to read all the depositions in the inquiry if there was a chance he could possibly change his mind.“Have you closed the door completely to an article of impeachment?” Todd asked.“No,” Cole replied. “Well, you never close the door completely to anything like this.”“But again, we just adopted a process that every single Republican said was unfair,” he continued. “We didn’t do the Clinton process or the Nixon process. So, I mean, I think the way the Democrats have handled this has sort of pushed Republicans together, whether they intended to or not. Now, am I open to listening? Of course. But all I know is that everything so far that&#39;s been presented behind closed doors, every Republican that has heard it did not vote this impeachment process.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

In her testimony, Yovanovitch alleges that the two men, in coordination with Giuliani, were key forces behind her eventual ouster.“There were two individuals from Florida, Mr. Parnas and Mr Fruman, who were working with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had set up the meetings for Mr. Giuliani with [former Ukrainian prosecutor] Mr. Lutsenko,” Yovanovitch said. “And that they were interested in having a different ambassador at post, I guess for — because they wanted to have business dealings in Ukraine, or additional business dealings.”<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

In her testimony, Yovanovitch alleges that the two men, in coordination with Giuliani, were key forces behind her eventual ouster.“There were two individuals from Florida, Mr. Parnas and Mr Fruman, who were working with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had set up the meetings for Mr. Giuliani with [former Ukrainian prosecutor] Mr. Lutsenko,” Yovanovitch said. “And that they were interested in having a different ambassador at post, I guess for — because they wanted to have business dealings in Ukraine, or additional business dealings.”<p><br clear=\"all\">'},\n",

Latest news from the inquiry, explained\" align=\"left\" title=\"Will Donald Trump be impeached? Latest news from the inquiry, explained\" border=\"0\" ></a>Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump after accusing him of violating\\xa0the US Constitution, plunging a deeply divided nation into yet another clash between Congress and the commander in chief. The US president\\xa0accused Democrats of another political &quot;witch hunt&quot;, summing up his view of the probe in an all-caps tweet:\\xa0 PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019 The Democrats&#39; course of action has thrown up a number of questions - adding to the\\xa0uncertainty already hanging over the 2020 election campaign - and tests anew the nation&#39;s constitutional system of checks and balances. We take a look at just a few of those questions below. What is impeachment and has it happened before? Impeachment is the process of removing a government official - in this case Donald Trump, the US president - from office. To trigger the process, an inquiry looks at whether the official&#39;s conduct falls under &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours”, as stated in Article Two of the US Constitution.\\xa0 Where things get tricky is the Constitution does not define &quot;high crimes and misdemeanours&quot;, so Congress must decide for itself what constitutes an impeachable offence. However, it is generally understood to mean a violation of an oath of office, rather than necessarily breaking the law. Richard Nixon resigned before an impeachment vote could be held Credit: AP Only three presidents have faced an impeachment inquiry - Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. In 1868, Mr Johnson was impeached by the House on charges relating to violating the Tenure of Office Act, over his firing of his Secretary of War, but he was acquitted in the Senate. After the 1974 Watergate scandal, a House committee\\xa0approved articles of impeachment against Mr Nixon, but he resigned before the full House held a vote. Mr Clinton was impeached by the House in 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice relating to a sexual harassment case against him but was then acquitted in the Senate.\\xa0 No president has ever been formally removed by the Senate.\\xa0 What is the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the inquiry?\\xa0 At the heart of the issue is whether Mr Trump held back aid to Ukraine in a bid to pressure the country to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Biden, the former US vice president, is currently the Democratic front-runner in the race to challenge Mr Trump for the White House in 2020.\\xa0 The trigger for the impeachment investigation was a phone call between Mr Trump and the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Concerns about the phone call were first revealed after a whistleblower filed a complaint accusing the president of abusing his power in order to interfere in the 2020 election. The impeachment probe centres on a call between\\xa0President Zelenskiy and Mr Trump\\xa0 Credit: AFP The whistleblower, a CIA officer previously assigned to the White House, said several officials had raised concerns about Mr Trump&#39;s conversation with Mr Zelenskiy. In response, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in late September that the chamber would open a formal impeachment proceeding to investigate the claims.\\xa0 A day\\xa0after the impeachment investigation began, the White House released a redacted version of the phone call which revealed that Mr Trump had indeed urged Mr Zelenskiy to do him a &quot;favour&quot; and investigate the Bidens.\\xa0 Overshadowing the request was the fact that it came days after Mr Trump held back almost $400 million in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. Mr Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong in calling for the investigation, saying there was no &quot;quid pro quo&quot; in his dealings with Ukraine. Why was Mr Trump calling for an investigation into the Bidens? Mr Trump and his allies have repeatedly suggested that while he was vice president, Mr Biden pushed for Ukraine&#39;s then prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, to be fired because he had been investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company where his son Hunter held a lucrative board position. The Bidens have vehemently denied any wrongdoing and in fact Mr Biden was not alone in calling for Mr Shokin&#39;s removal. The US government was backed by several European allies and the International Monetary Fund in criticising Mr Shokin for failing to tackle corruption, including in his own office. Mr Trump and others have also repeated an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukraine is in possession of a server containing hacked Democratic Party emails.\\xa0 Joe Biden and his son Hunter have vehemently denied any wrongdoing Credit: AP Since the impeachment investigation began, several key witnesses have given evidence revealing they had raised concerns about a shadow foreign policy being waged through Mr Trump&#39;s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to advance the president&#39;s own political agenda. One threat for the investigators is whether they lobbied for the removal of the US ambassador to Ukraine by pushing allegations she was against Mr Trump.\\xa0\\xa0 Among the most damning testimony was that of William Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, who told Congress that Mr Trump had made the release of military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens. The House committees have also released a string of text messages between Mr Taylor and other administration officials, in which Mr Taylor writes: &quot;I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign”. How does the impeachment process work?\\xa0 Process of impeachment Any House committee can bring charges of impeachment. Currently, there are six ongoing investigations into Mr Trump. Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has taken the most prominent role in leading the investigation so far, working with around three other committees.\\xa0 Over the next few months, six committees in the Democrat-controlled House will pursue an investigation that is likely to result in the chamber bringing articles of impeachment against Mr Trump. The investigators are also seeking evidence from several members of Mr Trump&#39;s inner circle, including Mr Giuliani, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, and former national security adviser John Bolton. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Credit: Susan Walsh/AP The White House has refused to co-operate with the probe, calling it a &quot;sham&quot;, but several current and former officials have already defied that edict to appear before investigators. House Republicans have also criticised the process and stormed one of the secure rooms where depositions are being held to publicise their opposition to the closed-door hearings. On October 31, the House held its first formal voted on its bid to oust Mr Trump, moving to progress the impeachment investigation into a public phase. The vote was 232 to 196 in favour of a resolution that outlined how the impeachment inquiry will progress. It means that investigators will soon hold hearings in the open and give both Republican and Democrat members the chance to question the witnesses called to give testimony. However leading House Republican dismissed the vote, calling it a &quot;tainted process&quot;.\\xa0 The House put a Congressional seal of approval on the next stage of the impeachment inquiry If the investigation concludes there is a cause for impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee will draw up articles of impeachment and vote on them. It will then go to a House-wide vote which requires a simple majority to pass. If the vote passes, Mr Trump will have been impeached - but not removed from office.\\xa0 A trial is then held in the Senate, with the House appointing members to act as &#39;prosecutors&#39; and all 100 senators acting as &#39;jurors&#39;. The chief justice of the Supreme Court oversees the trial. Two thirds of the Senate must find Mr Trump guilty in order for him to be convicted and removed from office. In such an event, the vice president becomes president.\\xa0\\xa0 What does the country\\xa0think about impeaching Trump? Does America support impeaching and removing Trump? For Mr Trump&#39;s first two years in office, the majority of the American public appeared to be against impeachment. That appears to have changed in the wake of the Ukraine scandal.\\xa0 Since the impeachment inquiry began, multiple polls, including one by the conservative network Fox News, have showed more of the public now favour an impeachment inquiry than oppose it. But it is a slim margin and there is a danger for Democrats that if the investigation drags on too long and becomes too complex, public mood will shift again.\\xa0 There were initial suggestions a House vote to impeach Mr Trump could happen as early as the end of November - but it could stretch into the new year. That could also cause an issue for Democratic presidential candidates, who do not want the issue hanging over an election year.\\xa0 So will Trump really be impeached and removed?\\xa0 In short, it seems pretty unlikely Mr Trump will be booted out of the White House. While Mr Trump is likely to be impeached by the House, where Democrats enjoy a majority, he is unlikely to be convicted by the Senate.\\xa0 The Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority in the Senate, which means around 20 senators would have to turn on their own president and vote against him. It would take something major for that to happen. Mr Trump&#39;s approval rating among his base remains strong and Republican voters are overwhelmingly against impeachment so senators are wary of going against his supporters, particularly with the election just a year away.\\xa0 There are some cracks in the Republican flank. Senior figures like senator Mitt Romney called the incident &quot;deeply troubling&quot; and former Ohio governor John Kasich said it made him &quot;sick to my stomach&quot;. But by and large Republicans in the House and the Senate have remained tight lipped - \\xa0acutely aware that voters in their home districts remain loyal to the president. The handful of sitting Republicans who have openly criticised Mr Trump&#39;s actions are typically from states where the president doesn&#39;t enjoy strong support. \\xa0\\xa0 Which Republican senators could turn? No Republican senator has publicly said they will back Mr Trump&#39;s removal, but suspicion has fallen under a number of names based on comments they have made since the scandal broke. Mitt Romney Republican senator Mitt Romney has been a vocal critic of the president Credit: James M. Dobson\\xa0/AP Mitt Romney is one of Mr Trump&#39;s most vocal critics within the Republican Party. He represents Utah, a state where the president is not popular, and does not face re-election until 2024, which gives him a licence to speak his mind on impeachment. He has refused to rule out impeaching the president, Mr Trump&#39;s actions on Ukraine &quot;wrong and appalling&quot;. Cory Gardner Cory Gardner faces a tough re-election battle in Colorado, a swing state. Mr Gardner has publicly called Mr Trump&#39;s phone call with the Ukrainian president a “serious issue”. Asked if he still supported Mr Trump’s reelection, Mr Gardner refused to say, adding: “Let’s find out what’s happening. Let’s get to the bottom of this.” Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski, a senator for Alaska, publicly broke with the White House position on the Ukraine scandal, saying: “You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period.” Ben Sasse The senator for Nebraska recently broke his silence on the Ukraine scandal, saying: “American elections should be for Americans. And the idea that we would have foreign nation-states coming into the American electoral process, or the information surrounding an election, is really, really bad.” However he later added: “Republicans ought not just circle the wagons, ... and Democrats ought not have been using words like impeachment before they knew anything about the actual substance.” Martha McSally Martha McSally is thought to be one of the most endangered Republicans in the Senate with Democrats hopeful they can take her Arizona seat in 2020. She criticised what she termed &quot;partisan bickering&quot; in the House impeachment investigation but also said it was a &quot;serious matter&quot;. Ms McSally has dodged questions about whether Mr Trump&#39;s Ukraine call was acceptable, but said: &quot;If it comes to the Senate, I&#39;m actually a juror ... so my job is to be thoughtful, to look at the facts and to show good judgment.&quot;<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

On October 31, the House held its first formal voted on its bid to oust Mr Trump, moving to progress the impeachment investigation into a public phase. The vote was 232 to 196 in favour of a resolution that outlined how the impeachment inquiry will progress. It means that investigators will soon hold hearings in the open and give both Republican and Democrat members the chance to question the witnesses called to give testimony. However leading House Republican dismissed the vote, calling it a &quot;tainted process&quot;.\\xa0 The House put a Congressional seal of approval on the next stage of the impeachment inquiry If the investigation concludes there is a cause for impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee will draw up articles of impeachment and vote on them. It will then go to a House-wide vote which requires a simple majority to pass. If the vote passes, Mr Trump will have been impeached - but not removed from office.\\xa0 A trial is then held in the Senate, with the House appointing members to act as &#39;prosecutors&#39; and all 100 senators acting as &#39;jurors&#39;. The chief justice of the Supreme Court oversees the trial. Two thirds of the Senate must find Mr Trump guilty in order for him to be convicted and removed from office. In such an event, the vice president becomes president.\\xa0\\xa0 What does the country\\xa0think about impeaching Trump? Does America support impeaching and removing Trump? For Mr Trump&#39;s first two years in office, the majority of the American public appeared to be against impeachment. That appears to have changed in the wake of the Ukraine scandal.\\xa0 Since the impeachment inquiry began, multiple polls, including one by the conservative network Fox News, have showed more of the public now favour an impeachment inquiry than oppose it. But it is a slim margin and there is a danger for Democrats that if the investigation drags on too long and becomes too complex, public mood will shift again.\\xa0 There were initial suggestions a House vote to impeach Mr Trump could happen as early as the end of November - but it could stretch into the new year. That could also cause an issue for Democratic presidential candidates, who do not want the issue hanging over an election year.\\xa0 So will Trump really be impeached and removed?\\xa0 In short, it seems pretty unlikely Mr Trump will be booted out of the White House. While Mr Trump is likely to be impeached by the House, where Democrats enjoy a majority, he is unlikely to be convicted by the Senate.\\xa0 The Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority in the Senate, which means around 20 senators would have to turn on their own president and vote against him. It would take something major for that to happen. Mr Trump&#39;s approval rating among his base remains strong and Republican voters are overwhelmingly against impeachment so senators are wary of going against his supporters, particularly with the election just a year away.\\xa0 There are some cracks in the Republican flank. Senior figures like senator Mitt Romney called the incident &quot;deeply troubling&quot; and former Ohio governor John Kasich said it made him &quot;sick to my stomach&quot;. But by and large Republicans in the House and the Senate have remained tight lipped - \\xa0acutely aware that voters in their home districts remain loyal to the president. The handful of sitting Republicans who have openly criticised Mr Trump&#39;s actions are typically from states where the president doesn&#39;t enjoy strong support. \\xa0\\xa0 Which Republican senators could turn? No Republican senator has publicly said they will back Mr Trump&#39;s removal, but suspicion has fallen under a number of names based on comments they have made since the scandal broke. Mitt Romney Republican senator Mitt Romney has been a vocal critic of the president Credit: James M. Dobson\\xa0/AP Mitt Romney is one of Mr Trump&#39;s most vocal critics within the Republican Party. He represents Utah, a state where the president is not popular, and does not face re-election until 2024, which gives him a licence to speak his mind on impeachment. He has refused to rule out impeaching the president, Mr Trump&#39;s actions on Ukraine &quot;wrong and appalling&quot;. Cory Gardner Cory Gardner faces a tough re-election battle in Colorado, a swing state. Mr Gardner has publicly called Mr Trump&#39;s phone call with the Ukrainian president a “serious issue”. Asked if he still supported Mr Trump’s reelection, Mr Gardner refused to say, adding: “Let’s find out what’s happening. Let’s get to the bottom of this.” Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski, a senator for Alaska, publicly broke with the White House position on the Ukraine scandal, saying: “You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period.” Ben Sasse The senator for Nebraska recently broke his silence on the Ukraine scandal, saying: “American elections should be for Americans. And the idea that we would have foreign nation-states coming into the American electoral process, or the information surrounding an election, is really, really bad.” However he later added: “Republicans ought not just circle the wagons, ... and Democrats ought not have been using words like impeachment before they knew anything about the actual substance.” Martha McSally Martha McSally is thought to be one of the most endangered Republicans in the Senate with Democrats hopeful they can take her Arizona seat in 2020. She criticised what she termed &quot;partisan bickering&quot; in the House impeachment investigation but also said it was a &quot;serious matter&quot;. Ms McSally has dodged questions about whether Mr Trump&#39;s Ukraine call was acceptable, but said: &quot;If it comes to the Senate, I&#39;m actually a juror ... so my job is to be thoughtful, to look at the facts and to show good judgment.&quot;<p><br clear=\"all\">'},\n",

Some residents are returning home after California&#39;s largest evacuation in history to find their home and belongings have turned to ashes.Fires ignited across California and were fanned by strong winds last week -- the blazes threatened expensive Los Angeles area homes and the Getty Center, swept through agricultural land, closed the 405 Freeway, and almost burned down a presidential library.Even though firefighters worked tirelessly to extinguish multiple fires, they weren&#39;t able to protect everyone&#39;s homes and businesses.Ken Wilson, the owner of Soda Rock Winery, bought the winery in 2000 and served patrons local wine for 19 years until the exploding Kincade Fire threatened his business.As of Monday morning, the Kincade Fire has charred more than 77,000 acres of land in Sonoma County, which is located right in the heart of California wine country, since it first ignited on Oct. 23, 2019. It is 80 percent contained.

Soda Rock Winery distilled to ashes after the Kincade Fire destroyed his business in Healdsburg, California.    &quot;A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into it for many years so it&#39;s hard to imagine all of those years going away,&quot; Wilson said.However, Wilson is looking at the glass as half full, despite all of his losses. The flames spared his vineyards, and much of the inventory of wine is stored off-site and is still good to sell. Also, he is thankful his employees are OK.    Soda Rock Winery before the Kincade fire turned it to dust.     &quot;I imagine things will get better around here also with the fires. I think that maybe we will have different management in place,&quot; Wilson said.&quot;We left in our pajamas and that was it,&quot; Bernadette Laos told AccuWeather reporter Bill Wadell in an interview.\\xa0Laos and her husband, Justo, had heeded evacuation warnings as the Kincade Fire approached.When mandatory evacuations were lifted, Laos said she hesitated to return home to see the destruction. But when they did return, they found the fire had decimated their home near Geyserville, California, and they began sifting through charred possessions.It took hours of searching and some help from friends, but Laos told Waldell they were able to salvage jewelry -- and her husband&#39;s wedding ring.

Justo and Burnadette Laos show a photo of the home they rented that was destroyed by the Kincade Fire near Geyserville, Calif. Thursday, Oct. 31, 2019. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)    Ellie Laks looked across the animal sanctuary founded on her dream to help animals and people alike. A few horses stood calmly in a pasture, waiting patiently at the gate, but thick smoke was rolling in over the mountains. The Tick Fire was rapidly approaching.&quot;It&#39;s moving very, very fast,&quot; Laks said, a few flames visible from over the mountains. The orange-brown smoke blotted out most of the sky.With the power out, Laks took to Twitter to\\xa0call for help\\xa0in evacuating the 100 or so animals that called the sanctuary home as the Tick Fire crept over the mountainside.&quot;The Gentle Barn is home to animals who have nowhere else to go because they&#39;re too old, too sick, too lame or too scared to be adoptable,&quot; Laks told AccuWeather in a phone interview.Dogs, birds, cows, sheep, pigs and other animals that called the sanctuary home were loaded up and driven off to about four different locations. Even a few oddballs like\\xa0Earl the emu\\xa0and\\xa0King the llama\\xa0had found a new temporary refuge.Problems with the evacuation arose, however, when animals such as\\xa0Zeus, an old, 750-pound pig, physically couldn&#39;t step up into a trailer to evacuate. Pigs typically live to 4 to 5 years old, according to The Gentle Barn. Zeus is still kicking at 12 years of age.The sanctuary also had concerns for one of their older cows, who they feared would have a fatal slip trying to step into the trailer.And then there was\\xa0Zoe.The Belgian draft horse had put on the brakes at the door of the trailer, refusing to leave her home.&quot;There was nothing wrong with her,&quot; Laks said. &quot;There&#39;s nothing physically challenging for her, she just didn&#39;t want to, and how are you going to make a 2,500-pound horse do anything?&quot;From the afternoon until midnight, Laks, staff and volunteers worked to load the animals that they could into trucks and trailers. They crated the chickens and turkeys, led the goats by leashes and their horns and carried the sheep before loading the horses and cattle into the remaining trailers. The volunteers that didn&#39;t have trailers and couldn&#39;t lead the animals lined the street at the edge of the five acres, armed with fire extinguishers, jackets, and blankets trying to put out approaching flames.Weighing their options with the winds starting to ease up, the decision was made to keep animals like Zeus, Zoe and a potbelly pig, named\\xa0Jellie,\\xa0at the sanctuary while staying up for the rest of the night to keep an eye on the progress of the flames.The animals made it safely through the night, but the sanctuary owner said they are praying for the winds to die down and end the threat for flames to spread toward the refuge for the animals.The Tick Fire has been 100 percent contained after it burned 4,615 acres in Los Angeles County over the course of 10 days. The fire claimed 22 structures and damaged another 27.<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

And that would make this whole process more political than I would like for it to be,” Clyburn said. He added that beyond politics, “this country is worth saving.”A year out from the 2020 election, 49% of those surveyed in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken Oct. 27-30 said they support the impeachment and removal of Trump, up from 43% a month ago. Still, 90% of Republicans are opposed, the poll showed. A Fox News poll had a similar top-line result, with 49% in favor of impeachment, although that was down from 51% in early October.Clyburn suggested that poll’s assessment of GOP support was too high, saying there’s “rising Republican support” for Trump’s impeachment when measured outside of the lawmakers standing resolutely behind the president.Also on CNN, Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway said the president’s conduct toward Ukraine -- the centerpiece of the Democrats’ inquiry -- was “not impeachable.” Conway added that she didn’t know if the White House had held up aid to Ukraine for a time to achieve Trump’s goal of having the former Soviet republic investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, and his son.Democrats’ ResolutionConway criticized the inquiry days after House Democrats passed a resolution kicking off the public phase of their accelerating investigation that could see Trump impeached, potentially by the end of the year. The resolution sends a clear signal that a vote to impeach Trump, and then a trial in the Senate, is all but inevitable. Not a single GOP House member voted in favor of the resolution last week.In a separate interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Conway said she wasn’t sure if the president had told former National Security Adviser John Bolton that he couldn’t testify as part of the House inquiry. Bolton’s lawyers have suggested he will not appear as scheduled this week.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg News that she expects the Democratic-led inquiry to begin public hearings this month, though she insisted there’s no deadline to finish the investigation.Transcripts ComingRepresentative Jim Himes of Connecticut, a senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats will release the transcripts from the closed-door hearings that have occurred in recent weeks.The public “will see what I’ve seen, which is the president’s most ferocious defenders, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Lee Zeldin, hammering these witnesses in these closed hearings,” Himes said on Fox.The House Intelligence Committee will likely release the hearing transcripts this week and begin public hearings the week after, Democratic Representative Jackie Speier of California, a panel member, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”Regardless of how it unfolds from here, the process is still wrong, Conway said on Fox. “You cannot cure what has been a flawed process from the beginning,” she said. “You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube.”Republican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the deputy minority whip, said he wouldn’t close the door to approving an article of impeachment against Trump, but that he doesn’t think Trump did anything that “rises to that level.” He said there’s “very little likelihood” the president will be removed by the Republican-controlled Senate based on the evidence presented so far.“So we’ve made a political decision to put everything on hold, divide the country for an outcome that we know -- and we’re doing it -- what’s going to happen,” Cole said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “That doesn’t make a lot of political sense and it’s bad for the country.”Democratic House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel of New York was reminded on ABC’s “This Week” that he made similar comments in the 1990s during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Engel said the situation with Trump is different.“It’s not a matter of will it be successful or whatever, that’s secondary,” Engel said. “The question you have to ask is, did the president really sell out his country with a bribe to a foreign power to get involved in the president’s personal, political election.”About CorruptionRepresentative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House minority whip, insisted on ABC that Trump wasn’t talking about a political opponent but corruption when the president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to look into corruption and mentioned allegations against Biden.Even so, former White House adviser Steve Bannon said on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that Biden and his son, Hunter, must be called to testify during impeachment hearings. Trump has made unsubstantiated charges of corruption against the Bidens in part because Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company.“Joe Biden is a hand grenade, and Hunter Biden’s the pin,” Bannon said. “And when that pin gets pulled, the shrapnel is going to blow back all over the Democratic establishment.”Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, said on CBS that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and his staff should be called to testify about how they handled a whistle-blower’s complaint regarding Trump’s July phone call with the Ukrainian president. Republicans have questioned whether the whistle-blower was coached and said he didn’t hear the call. McCarthy also said he wants the whistle-blower to testify.But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on CBS that multiple people who listened to the call have confirmed the whistle-blower’s account.“The problem that Kevin has and the Republicans have is witness after witness after witness says, ‘Yes, I was there, I listened, those are the facts,”’ Hoyer said.Facing PerilRecent moves suggest that Trump understands the peril he faces. After resisting entreaties to add staff to the White House, he is likely to bring on a prominent public relations professional to help with communications about the inquiry, people familiar with the matter have said. His campaign, meanwhile, paid millions of dollars for a glitzy national television ad during the seventh and deciding game of baseball’s World Series.Several polls in the past month have shown a swing toward public support for an inquiry, if not actual impeachment. But, like the new NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, it’s mostly driven by Democrats and independents. The overwhelming majority of Republicans continue to back Trump.The acrimony over the impeachment effort may only widen as the process heads toward a more public airing of the details of Trump‘s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats and Biden.With many of the facts already confirmed publicly by White House documents and Trump himself, the ultimate question for lawmakers to decide will be whether that conduct is impeachable.(Updates with comments from Cole, McCarthy and Hoyer from 12th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Mark Niquette.To contact the reporters on this story: Hailey Waller in New York at hwaller@bloomberg.net;Laura Davison in Washington at ldavison4@bloomberg.net;David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Steve GeimannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

But concerns have been mounting generally about alleged corruption among some senior Afghan officials. Few, if any, of the properties appear to have been declared on official registers, as is required by Afghanistan’s often ignored and broadly ineffective anti-corruption rules.The evidence of luxury property ownership in Dubai raises concerns that merit further investigation, according to a leading anti-corruption charity.“It’s too easy for officials to buy property in Dubai with anonymity,” said Maira Matini, from Transparency International. “There&#39;s no information available that would help detect wrongdoing. There needs to be more transparency.Afghanistan’s Cycle of Corruption“This doesn’t mean that those officials are corrupt,” she added. “However, it does raise red flags and needs to be investigated by the authorities.”Over the past twenty years, Afghanistan has been rocked by numerous corruption scandals, some of which have gone to the very top. From wartime contracts to unchecked foreign aid and CIA suitcases full of cash funneled to favored politicians and warlords, corruption has proved a stubborn problem to solve. The U.S. special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction has said: “While Afghanistan undoubtedly had a corruption problem prior to 2001, U.S. and coalition spending acted as gasoline thrown on an already burning fire.”Despite numerous initiatives, critics have lambasted government programs to tackle corruption, with one calling them “cosmetic.”The reputation of the Afghan government has ramifications for the country as a whole. Last month the U.S. announced it would cut $160 million in aid, accusing Afghanistan of failing to fight corruption—only a week before the country’s presidential elections began. It is rare for Washington to withhold direct funding from Kabul, which relies heavily on its support.The Bureau’s findings are based on a leak of property data in Dubai, first obtained by the U.S. non-profit C4ADS and shared with the Bureau by Finance Uncovered and OCCRP. The Bureau then cross-referenced this data against official and public records to corroborate the findings.The minister for parliamentary affairs was listed as the owner of an apartment in the Amwaj development.GettyThe results shed light on assets held in the usually secretive emirate. The Bureau found numerous Afghan officials and relatives have recently owned property in Dubai, including members of prominent political families that have been linked to some of Afghanistan’s biggest corruption scandals.One leading Afghan found to have owned property in Dubai is Ahmad Wali Massoud, who is currently running for president. A leaked diplomatic cable alleged that in October 2009, his brother Ahmad Zia Massoud, then the vice-president of Afghanistan, flew into the UAE with $52 million in cash.Also in the records was Adib Ahmad Fahim, a senior intelligence official. His late father, General Mohammed Qasim Fahim, another former vice-president, was identified as the part owner of Pamir Airways in a U.S. diplomatic cable. The airline was believed to have ferried money to Dubai hidden in airplane food trays. Fahim’s uncle Haseen was also a major shareholder in Kabul bank, which was at the centre of a massive scandal over millions of dollars allegedly given out in suspect insider loans before it collapsed in 2010.Ghulam Farooq Wardak, the state minister for parliamentary affairs, appears in the records with his wife. They recently owned two properties in exclusive areas of Dubai, including one on Jumeirah beach.Wardak was previously Afghanistan’s education minister, and his successor in the post raised concerns over possible corruption at the ministry. An investigation ordered by President Ashraf Ghani is said to have found evidence of embezzlement within the ministry and inaccurate data records on the number of schools that diverted money from donors.Two members of Afghanistan’s parliament appear in the list. Saleh Mohammad Lala Gul and Feda Mohammad Ulfat, who are father and son, owned a villa in the springs and another in the Jumeirah Park area. Both are flashy residences with features such as man-made lakes and swimming pools.Saleh Mohammad Lala Gul and his son Feda Mohammad Ulfat, both Afghan MPs, were recorded as owners of a home in the Jumeirah Park area.GettyClose relatives of two former presidents also appear in the list. One is Fatima Rabbani, whose late father, Burhanuddin Rabbani, led Afghanistan in the late 1990s. Her brother was, until this week, a foreign affairs minister. She runs various businesses in Dubai, including an upmarket restaurant and a business selling luxury products with the niece of another person in the records, former Afghan ambassador to Jordan, Sayed Mohammad Gailani.The other is Mahmood Karzai, the brother of the former president Hamid Karzai. He was also a shareholder of Kabul bank and, alongside Fahim’s uncle, there have been concerns that he sought to use his closeness to the very top of Afghanistan’s leadership to assist in protecting the bank from greater scrutiny.In an email, Mahmood Karzai confirmed ownership of a property in Dubai and said he had lived in the country since 2007. He denied any wrongdoing or corruption, and said he had attempted to sue the private investigation firm Kroll for a report it wrote alleging misconduct on his part in Afghanistan.None of the other people named in the records responded to multiple requests for comment in English, Dari or Pashto.Afghan law appears to require people in positions of authority – known as “politically exposed persons”—to publicly declare their assets and source of funds, as well as those of their close relatives. Few, if any, of the individuals named in the leaked Dubai documents appear to have declared such assets, but experts say the laws are not fit for purpose, and contain many loopholes that could allow someone to not disclose an asset without breaching the rules.Fatima Rabbani, the daughter of Afghanistan’s former president, was listed as owning a property in the Fairooz development.GettySayed Ikram Afzali, the director of anti-corruption organization Integrity Watch Afghanistan, said the disclosure system had proved useless.“The asset forms are largely incomplete, the data published is inconsistent and not verified, and even at times contradictory. You could say it’s a useless system,” he said. “It’s an ineffective system and it&#39;s not meant to be effective. It&#39;s a system the government is following to keep international donors happy.“I doubt that the Afghan government means to achieve anything through this process, aside from ticking a box to keep the international community happy,” Afzali added.Anti-corruption efforts in Afghanistan have a checkered history. President Karzai attempted to clamp down on corruption, partly in efforts to please international partners, setting up an anti-corruption office in 2008 whose duties included registering the assets of public officials. The office was quickly mired in controversy—after damning criticism of its first attempts, Karzai appointed a new head, choosing an official who had been previously accused of election fraud.That office was eventually shut down, and there have been successive attempts to get Afghan officials to register their assets. Stronger legislation was introduced in 2017, but years on, asset registration for officials is seen as a failure.The body in charge of the current register has been placed under the office of the president, raising concerns from anti-corruption activists. Questions have been raised over its independence: its latest director, Naheed Esar, has recently been appointed the new deputy foreign minister.Sarah Chayes, an anti-corruption expert who has advised the U.S. military in Afghanistan, said the Afghanistan needed to work on tackling corruption and rebuilding trust in its ruling class in a root and branch way.“Corruption in Afghanistan is systemic. It is perpetrated by networks,” she said.“For years I heard comments from my neighbors like: ‘The Taliban shakes us down at night, and the government shakes us down in the daytime.’” Chayes added: “The difference is, the government is supposed to be upholding the law, but is violating it.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

But the departure of the plane sent to evacuate the attache was delayed for hours for no apparent reason despite protests from embassy officials and the State Department in Washington, according to several Trump administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic issue that some other officials prefer to play down.The Russians eventually relented, and the American, a uniformed officer, was safely evacuated, the officials said.While State and Defense Department officials confirmed there was a medical incident in Russia, they declined to identify the officer and would not provide any details of the case or why he was being evacuated.&quot;There was a Department of Defense official from the U.S. Embassy in Russia that had to be medevacked from the U.S. Embassy out of Russia,&quot; said Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman.Military attache offices operate openly in most U.S. Embassies, and are managed by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon&#39;s intelligence arm. A webpage for the office in Moscow says that it &quot;serves as the primary point of contact for all joint U.S.-Russia military activities and communications on defense matters.&quot;The State Department&#39;s undersecretary of state for management, Brian Bulatao, raised the episode with Russian officials in early September during a meeting in Vienna convened to discuss what one of the Trump administration officials called &quot;bilateral irritants,&quot; including the harassment of Americans. But it is not clear how the Russian officials responded.Former U.S. officials with experience in Russia said they could not recall a similar incident happening before and viewed the episode as potentially representing an escalation by Moscow. But they said it would also be consistent with years of intimidation tactics against American diplomats in the Russian capital.&quot;If we were bringing in a plane, that means this was really serious. That does not happen very often,&quot; said Michael A. McFaul, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Moscow during the Obama administration.&quot;When I was ambassador, we felt like we were under siege all the time,&quot; McFaul said. He said that delaying a medical flight would fit &quot;the kind of classic harassment that for many years now our people have been putting up with. It&#39;s inexcusable, it&#39;s horrible.&quot;Russia&#39;s internal security service, which Vladimir Putin once directed, &quot;wants foreign officials and their families to feel like they&#39;re on enemy soil inside Russia,&quot; said Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA station chief who spent five years in Moscow. &quot;They want officials and their families to be under duress,&quot; and unable to focus on their jobs.&quot;The idea that they would interfere with medical care or put someone&#39;s life or well-being at risk is taking the harassment for which Russia has been known since the days of the KGB to a new and dangerous level,&quot; Hoffman added.Adding to the diplomatic strain is the Russian detention since December of Paul N. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine whom the Russians arrested in Moscow and charged with spying. Whelan, who denies the charges, faces up to 20 years in prison.And in mid-October, Russian authorities removed three American diplomats from a train headed to an Arctic town near the site of a recent nuclear accident. The State Department said they &quot;were on official travel and had properly notified Russian authorities of their travel.&quot;It is also a sensitive moment for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The American ambassador to Russia, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., left his post last month, and President Donald Trump has nominated John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, to succeed him.In a statement, Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry played down the delay of the attache&#39;s departure. It said that the ailing American military officer had passed &quot;right through&quot; border control while still in an ambulance, and that a &quot;slight delay&quot; of about 20 minutes occurred during boarding because the diplomat&#39;s &quot;foreign doctors&quot; were mistakenly declared as crew members and required boarding passes, which took time to process.&quot;We also inform you that the illness of the American diplomat was not serious. He recovered a long time ago and returned to his place of work in Moscow,&quot; the statement added.But an American official said the Russians insisted that the ailing employee undergo &quot;needless&quot; security screening, which required separating him from his doctors and medical equipment.&quot;It was eventually smoothed over through diplomatic channels,&quot; said the American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address delicate diplomatic interactions.The official said the officer returned to Moscow and his duties at the embassy soon after &quot;a medical appointment&quot; in Germany. The official said the officer&#39;s condition was not urgent, but could not immediately explain why he needed a medevac aircraft rather than a commercial flight.The Russian statement also pointed a finger back at the United States, charging that it had interfered several years ago with the medical care of Russia&#39;s former prime minister and foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov. A Russian diplomat in the United States was detained by American authorities after going to a pharmacy to buy medicine for Primakov, who was gravely ill with cancer in Moscow, the statement said,&quot;The medicine was delivered to Russia only after the U.S. Secretary of State, J. Kerry, got involved,&quot; the Russian statement charged, referring to John Kerry, who served in that role under President Barack Obama. &quot;But time was wasted.&quot;Primakov died of cancer in June 2015 at age 85. Several U.S. officials familiar with the episode said the Russians had been illegally procuring the drugs, drawing the attention of FBI officials who were unaware of Primakov&#39;s connection to the matter.Despite Trump&#39;s outreach to Putin, relations between Washington and Moscow remain generally hostile, and Russian intimidation of American officials in their country has reached levels unseen since the Cold War, current and former American officials say.And while Trump continues to speak in forgiving tones about Putin -- and even suggesting that Russia might rejoin the Group of 7 -- many senior Trump administration officials are furious over the Russian harassment campaign.Harassment of American officials has increased in recent years as relations between the United States and Russia have steadily deteriorated, particularly after the imposition of sanctions to punish Russian aggression against Ukraine and the Kremlin&#39;s 2016 election interference. The problem grew serious enough that Kerry personally raised the issue with Putin during a March 2016 meeting.That exchange did little good. Three months later, a Russian security guard stationed outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow tackled an American diplomat trying to enter the building, breaking his shoulder before the American managed to get inside. Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry insisted the diplomat was a spy.&quot;The more the US damages relations, the harder it will be for US diplomats to work in Russia,&quot; the official account for Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry tweeted soon afterward.Russian officials in America are not harassed or intimidated in the United States, current and former U.S. officials say, although they are closely monitored.&quot;We debated whether we should respond in kind,&quot; McFaul said, including by more conspicuously tailing Russian officials or staging protests outside the Russian Embassy in Washington. No such actions were ever taken, McFaul added, &quot;because we didn&#39;t want to become them.&quot;But the United States did expel dozens of Russian diplomats after the poisoning last year of the former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter in Britain.The Russians responded by kicking out dozens of U.S. embassy employees and shutting down the American Consulate in St. Petersburg. Both the American and Russian government are interested in returning some of their employees, but officials described the summer episode as a potential obstacle.Hoffman warned that, without pushback from Washington, American diplomats in Russia would continue to suffer harassment and intimidation.&quot;When Russia has in rare circumstances crossed the line, it has been important to hold them accountable and make it a part of our bilateral relationship,&quot; he said. &quot;If we fail to do so, then we will risk Russia continuing to do so.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

But the departure of the plane sent to evacuate the attache was delayed for hours for no apparent reason despite protests from embassy officials and the State Department in Washington, according to several Trump administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic issue that some other officials prefer to play down.The Russians eventually relented, and the American, a uniformed officer, was safely evacuated, the officials said.While State and Defense Department officials confirmed there was a medical incident in Russia, they declined to identify the officer and would not provide any details of the case or why he was being evacuated.&quot;There was a Department of Defense official from the U.S. Embassy in Russia that had to be medevacked from the U.S. Embassy out of Russia,&quot; said Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman.Military attache offices operate openly in most U.S. Embassies, and are managed by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon&#39;s intelligence arm. A webpage for the office in Moscow says that it &quot;serves as the primary point of contact for all joint U.S.-Russia military activities and communications on defense matters.&quot;The State Department&#39;s undersecretary of state for management, Brian Bulatao, raised the episode with Russian officials in early September during a meeting in Vienna convened to discuss what one of the Trump administration officials called &quot;bilateral irritants,&quot; including the harassment of Americans. But it is not clear how the Russian officials responded.Former U.S. officials with experience in Russia said they could not recall a similar incident happening before and viewed the episode as potentially representing an escalation by Moscow. But they said it would also be consistent with years of intimidation tactics against American diplomats in the Russian capital.&quot;If we were bringing in a plane, that means this was really serious. That does not happen very often,&quot; said Michael A. McFaul, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Moscow during the Obama administration.&quot;When I was ambassador, we felt like we were under siege all the time,&quot; McFaul said. He said that delaying a medical flight would fit &quot;the kind of classic harassment that for many years now our people have been putting up with. It&#39;s inexcusable, it&#39;s horrible.&quot;Russia&#39;s internal security service, which Vladimir Putin once directed, &quot;wants foreign officials and their families to feel like they&#39;re on enemy soil inside Russia,&quot; said Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA station chief who spent five years in Moscow. &quot;They want officials and their families to be under duress,&quot; and unable to focus on their jobs.&quot;The idea that they would interfere with medical care or put someone&#39;s life or well-being at risk is taking the harassment for which Russia has been known since the days of the KGB to a new and dangerous level,&quot; Hoffman added.Adding to the diplomatic strain is the Russian detention since December of Paul N. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine whom the Russians arrested in Moscow and charged with spying. Whelan, who denies the charges, faces up to 20 years in prison.And in mid-October, Russian authorities removed three American diplomats from a train headed to an Arctic town near the site of a recent nuclear accident. The State Department said they &quot;were on official travel and had properly notified Russian authorities of their travel.&quot;It is also a sensitive moment for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The American ambassador to Russia, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., left his post last month, and President Donald Trump has nominated John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, to succeed him.In a statement, Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry played down the delay of the attache&#39;s departure. It said that the ailing American military officer had passed &quot;right through&quot; border control while still in an ambulance, and that a &quot;slight delay&quot; of about 20 minutes occurred during boarding because the diplomat&#39;s &quot;foreign doctors&quot; were mistakenly declared as crew members and required boarding passes, which took time to process.&quot;We also inform you that the illness of the American diplomat was not serious. He recovered a long time ago and returned to his place of work in Moscow,&quot; the statement added.But an American official said the Russians insisted that the ailing employee undergo &quot;needless&quot; security screening, which required separating him from his doctors and medical equipment.&quot;It was eventually smoothed over through diplomatic channels,&quot; said the American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address delicate diplomatic interactions.The official said the officer returned to Moscow and his duties at the embassy soon after &quot;a medical appointment&quot; in Germany. The official said the officer&#39;s condition was not urgent, but could not immediately explain why he needed a medevac aircraft rather than a commercial flight.The Russian statement also pointed a finger back at the United States, charging that it had interfered several years ago with the medical care of Russia&#39;s former prime minister and foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov. A Russian diplomat in the United States was detained by American authorities after going to a pharmacy to buy medicine for Primakov, who was gravely ill with cancer in Moscow, the statement said,&quot;The medicine was delivered to Russia only after the U.S. Secretary of State, J. Kerry, got involved,&quot; the Russian statement charged, referring to John Kerry, who served in that role under President Barack Obama. &quot;But time was wasted.&quot;Primakov died of cancer in June 2015 at age 85. Several U.S. officials familiar with the episode said the Russians had been illegally procuring the drugs, drawing the attention of FBI officials who were unaware of Primakov&#39;s connection to the matter.Despite Trump&#39;s outreach to Putin, relations between Washington and Moscow remain generally hostile, and Russian intimidation of American officials in their country has reached levels unseen since the Cold War, current and former American officials say.And while Trump continues to speak in forgiving tones about Putin -- and even suggesting that Russia might rejoin the Group of 7 -- many senior Trump administration officials are furious over the Russian harassment campaign.Harassment of American officials has increased in recent years as relations between the United States and Russia have steadily deteriorated, particularly after the imposition of sanctions to punish Russian aggression against Ukraine and the Kremlin&#39;s 2016 election interference. The problem grew serious enough that Kerry personally raised the issue with Putin during a March 2016 meeting.That exchange did little good. Three months later, a Russian security guard stationed outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow tackled an American diplomat trying to enter the building, breaking his shoulder before the American managed to get inside. Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry insisted the diplomat was a spy.&quot;The more the US damages relations, the harder it will be for US diplomats to work in Russia,&quot; the official account for Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry tweeted soon afterward.Russian officials in America are not harassed or intimidated in the United States, current and former U.S. officials say, although they are closely monitored.&quot;We debated whether we should respond in kind,&quot; McFaul said, including by more conspicuously tailing Russian officials or staging protests outside the Russian Embassy in Washington. No such actions were ever taken, McFaul added, &quot;because we didn&#39;t want to become them.&quot;But the United States did expel dozens of Russian diplomats after the poisoning last year of the former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter in Britain.The Russians responded by kicking out dozens of U.S. embassy employees and shutting down the American Consulate in St. Petersburg. Both the American and Russian government are interested in returning some of their employees, but officials described the summer episode as a potential obstacle.Hoffman warned that, without pushback from Washington, American diplomats in Russia would continue to suffer harassment and intimidation.&quot;When Russia has in rare circumstances crossed the line, it has been important to hold them accountable and make it a part of our bilateral relationship,&quot; he said. &quot;If we fail to do so, then we will risk Russia continuing to do so.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company<p><br clear=\"all\">'},\n",

Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The Guardian Pacifying MexicoWhen Andrés Manuel López Obrador became Mexico’s president last December he vowed to “pacify” one of Latin America’s most violent nations by waging war on the social roots of crime.But nearly a year later there is scant sign of progress, as the country reels from a series of humiliating high-profile attacks and murder statistics surge to levels not seen even during the darkest days of Felipe Calderón’s 2006-2012 “war on drugs”.Calderón sends in the armyMexico’s “war on drugs” began in late 2006 when the president at the time, Felipe Calderón, ordered thousands of troops onto the streets in response to an explosion of horrific violence in his native state of Michoacán.Calderón hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico’s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed.Kingpin strategySimultaneously Calderón also began pursuing the so-called “kingpin strategy” by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps – notably Arturo Beltrán Leyva who was gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009 – but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.Under Calderón’s successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, the government’s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world’s most murderous mafia groups.But Calderón’s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa’s Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.When “El Chapo” was arrested in early 2016, Mexico’s president bragged: “Mission accomplished”. But the violence went on. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.&quot;Hugs not bullets&quot;The leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime, offering vocational training to more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels.  “It will be virtually impossible to achieve peace without justice and [social] welfare,” Amlo said, promising to slash the murder rate from an average of 89 killings per day with his “hugs not bullets” doctrine.Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong &quot;National Guard&quot;. But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.Last month Mexico’s security chief, Alfonso Durazo, claimed the crisis was reaching “inflection point” – only for his upbeat message to be imploded by a week of mayhem which saw cartel gunmen slay 13 police officers and then paralyze a major city in order to free the son of Mexico’s most famous drug lord, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.In the first nine months of this year, Mexico suffered an average of close to 100 murders a day.Tijuana has seen a methamphetamine-fuelled murder epidemic which produced a record 2,518 murders in 2018 and looks set to cause even more this year.“The state has lost control,” said Victor Clark, a security expert and activist based in the city.A man carrying a Mexican flag walks through downtown Tijuana to celebrate the country’s recent independence day. Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The Guardian ‘Killings that matter to no one’To explore the violence blighting Latin America’s number two economy the Guardian spent seven days reporting from Tijuana – one of the world’s most deadly cities – between 4 and 11 October.The Guardian’s week had an unusually peacefully start, with not a single murder recorded in the first 24 hours, according to the newly elected mayor, Arturo González Cruz.González, a López Obrador ally, claimed that had not happened in several years and voiced frustration the media had ignored the achievement.But by day two the slaughter had resumed. At 6am a man’s body was found dumped in the eastern neighbourhood of Emperadores. At 11.35am a decomposing pair of legs were spotted on wasteland in the city’s south. And at 2.45pm an unidentified killer barged into a home on Calle Tamaulipas, pulled out a gun and brought an unidentified male’s life to an end..“Municipal police officers mounted an operation to track down the person thought responsible for the attack,” one local tabloid reported – though in a country where more than 90% of crimes go unpunished there was no indication they had succeeded.Outside Tijuana’s general hospital a bullet-riddled people-carrier bore witness to the latest gunfight.What had happened? “An accident,” a police investigator snapped, shooing reporters away as forensic science officers marked each of the entry holes with white cards marked A-K.The next evening 30-year-old Jesús Bernal staggered into an alley off Calle Belice, blood oozing from at least four separate gunshot wounds in his legs and wrists.Red Cross first responders treat 30-year-old Jesús Bernal after he was found with at least four separate gunshot wounds in his legs and wrists. Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The GuardianAs ambulance technicians strapped the blood-spattered man to a stretcher with silver duct tape, a police officer claimed he was a convicted burglar probably shot while trying to rob a local home.“It’s a punishment … a message,” speculated one of the first responders.But like so much of the bloodletting, the case would go unreported by newspapers, unnoticed by society and unsolved by the police.“These are killings that matter to no one,” Clark said.Tijuana’s new mayor, Arturo González Cruz, said the city’s murder crisis would only be solved by rehabilitating the city’s ‘social fabric’. Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The Guardian ‘An era of great psychological terror’It has been just over a decade since a savage turf war for control of drug smuggling routes into the United States made Tijuana one of the most ill-famed cities on Earth.There was an explosion of carnage in 2008 as El Chapo’s Sinaloa cartel tried to muscle in on what had long been the domain of the locally based Tijuana mob.Corpses were hung from bridges and shootouts raged, even in the city’s most glitzy corners. In one of the most disturbing episodes 12 corpses were abandoned with their tongues hacked out and placed nearby in a black plastic bag.“You couldn’t go out because you were scared of what might happen,” recalled Dora Elena Cortés, a local journalist whose Agencia Fronteriza de Noticias chronicled the butchery. “It was an era of great psychological terror.”Negative headlines sparked government action and by 2012 the number of annual murders had plunged. But Tijuana’s murder rate is now soaring once again with the slaughter so routine that one local newspaper features a muertómetro (deathometer) to help readers keep track.Authorities and academics blame the new wave of violence on a largely hidden dispute for Tijuana’s drug trade – particularly that of crystal meth – although Brianna Rojas’s murder did not seem to fit that mould.“These deaths aren’t about the fight for control of the routes into the US. They’re fighting over the local market,” said Clark.That appeared to be what was at stake on the night of 8 October when dozens of heavily armed police descended on a petrol station after a drive-by shooting left four men injured, one critically.Illuminated in the the red and blue lights of emergency vehicles, a half-naked man lay in a pool of blood, shot through the thigh and fighting for his life.Police officers interrogate one of four men injured in a drive-by shooting at a Tijuana petrol station on 8 October. Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The GuardianAfter a 10-minute race to the hospital, he was carried in past police with white skulls stamped on to their black uniforms and rifles slung from their shoulders. Investigators barked questions at the man’s three accomplices as they lay bleeding in the corridor.Mayor González admitted it was “unreal” to expect an immediate end to Tijuana’s murder crisis but hoped the body count could be reduced and insisted the city’s “economic dynamism” remained unaffected.During an interview at Tijuana’s brutalist city hall he reiterated the president’s doctrine that crime would only be stopped by rehabilitating Tijuana’s “social fabric” and eradicating corruption.“Corruption is the mother of all evils, because it affects everything,” González said.Clark, the expert who has spent decades tracking Tijuana’s security situation, was pessimistic such tactics alone would work. “So far nothing has changed – absolutely nothing,” he said of López Obrador’s first year in power.“I don’t doubt he has good intentions. But what they are doing isn’t enough.”For residents of Boulevard Fundadores, where Tijuana’s public mortuary is located, change cannot come fast enough.An addict approaches a hillside shooting gallery in Tijuana to buy drugs just minutes after a man was shot in the head inside. Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The GuardianOn the afternoon of 9 October, as Brianna Rojas’s mother came to recover her daughter’s corpse, the cloying stench of decomposing bodies hung in the air. “It’s horrible. Every single day we breathe death,” fumed one local woman who has been campaigning to get the morgue moved.The woman reached for her smartphone to show a series of macabre images depicting conditions inside. One showed perhaps two dozen naked corpses sprawled on the floor, a putrid tangle of bloodied limbs. “At night it’s like there are 60 dead dogs lying out here,” the woman complained of the reek. “We can’t open our windows.”Forty-eight hours later – as the week reached a bloody peak - emergency workers from Mexico’s Red Cross raced westwards to collect their latest cargo from a tumbledown community called Francisco Villa.A man was hauled semi-conscious from a hillside shooting gallery and hoisted into the ambulance, his arms bound with bandages to prevent him lashing out. “He got shot in the skull,” one of the team said.Would he survive? “50-50,” they replied.Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija<p><br clear=\"all\">',\n",

In one of the most disturbing episodes 12 corpses were abandoned with their tongues hacked out and placed nearby in a black plastic bag.“You couldn’t go out because you were scared of what might happen,” recalled Dora Elena Cortés, a local journalist whose Agencia Fronteriza de Noticias chronicled the butchery. “It was an era of great psychological terror.”Negative headlines sparked government action and by 2012 the number of annual murders had plunged. But Tijuana’s murder rate is now soaring once again with the slaughter so routine that one local newspaper features a muertómetro (deathometer) to help readers keep track.Authorities and academics blame the new wave of violence on a largely hidden dispute for Tijuana’s drug trade – particularly that of crystal meth – although Brianna Rojas’s murder did not seem to fit that mould.“These deaths aren’t about the fight for control of the routes into the US. They’re fighting over the local market,” said Clark.That appeared to be what was at stake on the night of 8 October when dozens of heavily armed police descended on a petrol station after a drive-by shooting left four men injured, one critically.Illuminated in the the red and blue lights of emergency vehicles, a half-naked man lay in a pool of blood, shot through the thigh and fighting for his life.Police officers interrogate one of four men injured in a drive-by shooting at a Tijuana petrol station on 8 October. Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The GuardianAfter a 10-minute race to the hospital, he was carried in past police with white skulls stamped on to their black uniforms and rifles slung from their shoulders. Investigators barked questions at the man’s three accomplices as they lay bleeding in the corridor.Mayor González admitted it was “unreal” to expect an immediate end to Tijuana’s murder crisis but hoped the body count could be reduced and insisted the city’s “economic dynamism” remained unaffected.During an interview at Tijuana’s brutalist city hall he reiterated the president’s doctrine that crime would only be stopped by rehabilitating Tijuana’s “social fabric” and eradicating corruption.“Corruption is the mother of all evils, because it affects everything,” González said.Clark, the expert who has spent decades tracking Tijuana’s security situation, was pessimistic such tactics alone would work. “So far nothing has changed – absolutely nothing,” he said of López Obrador’s first year in power.“I don’t doubt he has good intentions. But what they are doing isn’t enough.”For residents of Boulevard Fundadores, where Tijuana’s public mortuary is located, change cannot come fast enough.An addict approaches a hillside shooting gallery in Tijuana to buy drugs just minutes after a man was shot in the head inside. Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The GuardianOn the afternoon of 9 October, as Brianna Rojas’s mother came to recover her daughter’s corpse, the cloying stench of decomposing bodies hung in the air. “It’s horrible. Every single day we breathe death,” fumed one local woman who has been campaigning to get the morgue moved.The woman reached for her smartphone to show a series of macabre images depicting conditions inside. One showed perhaps two dozen naked corpses sprawled on the floor, a putrid tangle of bloodied limbs. “At night it’s like there are 60 dead dogs lying out here,” the woman complained of the reek. “We can’t open our windows.”Forty-eight hours later – as the week reached a bloody peak - emergency workers from Mexico’s Red Cross raced westwards to collect their latest cargo from a tumbledown community called Francisco Villa.A man was hauled semi-conscious from a hillside shooting gallery and hoisted into the ambulance, his arms bound with bandages to prevent him lashing out. “He got shot in the skull,” one of the team said.Would he survive? “50-50,” they replied.Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija<p><br clear=\"all\">'},\n",
